# Distributed Data Analysis and Mining
 Project for the exam of  Distributed Data Analysis and Mining. Dataset available in (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/flight-delay-dataset-20182022)

This kind of Data mining analysis was performed by a team of 5 people. The most interesting thing was the approaches to a new kind of framework.
In fact, as you can fastly discover by looking to the notebook, the syntactic way to write the common code is slightly different since we used the Spark Framework.

The dataset containing the data was not charged on this platform since the dimension of that file was too much big for the maintability of the system. 
Please, use the link of Kaggle above to gain the missed data

In order to better understand some thing that has moved us to performe some action, our suggestion is to firstly read the report(mainly in the part of Data Understanding
and Preparation), after that, move to read the code.
